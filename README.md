# Tweet-sentiment-analysis
This is a project for beginners. Source: [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stoicstatic/twitter-sentiment-analysis-for-beginners)

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, nltk, scikit-learn, seaborn, wordcloud

### Project status
The notebook is the latest version, stripped out of its output. The .pickle files present here may not be in the latest version, i.e. they may not correspond to what is generated by the notebook in its latest version but in one of the previous ones. This is because, for practicality reasons, changes in .pickle files are committed and pushed here only once in a while.

### Setup guide
- Clone the repo locally
- Install dependencies (using Pipenv: `pipenv install`)
- Run code blocks in main.ipynb
